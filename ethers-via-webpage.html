    This page allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain just via your browser, including on mobile devices. <br>
    The javascript library "ethers" has been loaded and can be interacted with using this page. <br>

    You will need to set up how you intend to connect to the blockchain via ethers commands, such as Snippet 1 or Snippet 2. <br>
    If you are on a mobile without a Dapp browser, Snippet 1 will probably not work. <br>

    <br>

    <b>IMPORTANT</b> - this is provided 'AS IS', as outlined in the MIT licence at the end of the page. Use is at your own risk, I myself would not transfer any more than a small amount of ETH to accounts controlled by this page and certainly <b>not provide any private keys</b> directly to this page via the Javascript box. Use at your own risk!
